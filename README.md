# BattedBallType_Classifier
Takes a dataset of over 34,000 batted balls (over 8,500 flyballs, popups, grounders, and line drives).

Accomplished an accuracy of around 94% using the Decision Trees Algorithm (used sklearn library) with the training set consisting of 85% of my batted ball data and the testing set consisting of 15% of my batted ball data. Used exit velocities and launch angles to make predictions about the type of hit. First, I performed density plots using the matplotlib library of the data using training sets. Then I overlaid it with a scatter plot from the data in my testing set.
